# React Context
This project carries ahead from the previous [React Routing](https://github.com/rohitjainfsl/react-routing) project.
In this, we have explained what context is, how it is created using the <em>createContext</em> function. 
And <em>useContext</em> hook to access that context.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
